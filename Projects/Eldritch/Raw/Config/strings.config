And now I have found myself in a dangerous world full of lurking monsters and treacherous traps.\n\nIf my research is correct, then I am in a lost temple to the ancient god Dagon.

In my research, I have learned of a \"Ritual of Binding\" which the mystics performed to contain the Old Ones the last time they threatened Earth.\n\nThe ritual of binding is performed by reading aloud the ancient words, which seals the invaders in an infinite prison spanning unknown dimensions; and then surrendering one person to serve as the eternal guardian of the prison.\n\nThe ritual may be augmented by lighting three candles. The candles will draw the targets to the heart of the prison and lull them into slumber.\n\nAncient texts speak of a further step in which the guardian's duty is relieved by the use of a consecrated surrogate, but the details are lost to time."
